## About Me

I received my Ph.D. from the Autonomous University of Barcelona and later worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Computer Vision Center in Spain. Prior to that, I received my M.S. from Northwestern Polytechnical University and my B.S. from Xidian University. I am currently an Assistant Professor at Nankai University. My research interests include continual learning, image and video compression, and dynamic networks.
